# F11.1 - AI Spec Quality Scoring

## Overview

Automated quality analysis for specification documents, scoring across five dimensions with weighted scoring, letter grades, and improvement priorities.

## Architecture

```
Client/lib/ai/
  spec-quality.ts        # Quality analysis, scoring, grading
  spec-quality.test.ts   # 79 tests
```

## Modules

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| analyzeCompleteness | Section count, word count, acceptance criteria, dependency tracking |
| analyzeClarity | Sentence length, ambiguous words, passive voice detection |
| analyzeConsistency | Title presence, duplicates, word count variance, structural uniformity |
| analyzeTestability | Acceptance criteria ratio, measurable outcomes, action verbs |
| analyzeFeasibility | Scope assessment, verbosity, complexity constraints, team capacity |
| generateQualityReport | Weighted composite of all dimensions with summary |
| getQualityGrade | Letter grade (A/B/C/D/F) from numeric score |
| getImprovementPriorities | Dimensions below 80, sorted worst-first |

## Scoring Weights

| Dimension | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Completeness | 25% |
| Testability | 25% |
| Clarity | 20% |
| Consistency | 15% |
| Feasibility | 15% |
