# F9.2 - Documentation Hub

## Overview

Documentation generation and search system for producing API docs, getting started guides, changelogs, and searchable documentation from structured data.

## Architecture

```
Client/lib/docs/
  doc-generator.ts    # API docs, getting started, changelog, TOC, page templates
  search-index.ts     # Inverted index search with ranked scoring
  docs.test.ts        # 45 tests
```

## Features

- **API Documentation**: Generates markdown from endpoint definitions with method, path, parameters, and response examples
- **Getting Started Guide**: Installation, setup, and quick start sections with navigation
- **Changelog**: Version-grouped entries organized by change type (Added, Changed, Fixed)
- **Table of Contents**: Nested markdown TOC from hierarchical section structure
- **Search**: Inverted index with scored results (title=10, keyword=5, content=1), match highlighting

## Test Coverage

45 tests: doc-generator (22), search-index (19), formatting (4).
