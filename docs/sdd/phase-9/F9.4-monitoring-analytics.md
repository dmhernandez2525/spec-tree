# F9.4 - Monitoring & Analytics

## Overview

Application monitoring toolkit with error tracking, health checks, feature usage metrics, and uptime tracking.

## Architecture

```
Client/lib/monitoring/
  error-tracker.ts    # Error capture, deduplication, severity tracking
  health-check.ts     # Endpoint health, aggregate status, auto-monitoring
  usage-metrics.ts    # Feature usage counts, session metrics
  uptime-tracker.ts   # Availability tracking, latency stats
  monitoring.test.ts  # 96 tests
```

## Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Error Tracker | Capture with dedup by message, severity filtering, top errors ranking, markdown reports, global handler setup |
| Health Check | Endpoint latency measurement, timeout handling, aggregate status (healthy/degraded/down), periodic monitoring with callbacks |
| Usage Metrics | 12 tracked features, running average duration, page views, session summary |
| Uptime Tracker | Record checks, percentage calculation, latency stats (min/max/avg), color-coded status |

## Tracked Features

spec-create, spec-edit, spec-delete, ai-generate, export-markdown, export-json, export-cursor, export-copilot, export-devin, collaboration-comment, github-sync, webhook-create

## Test Coverage

96 tests: error-tracker (26), health-check (10), usage-metrics (28), uptime-tracker (32).
